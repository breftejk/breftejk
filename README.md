# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm **Marcin** â€“ a 19-year-old programming enthusiast with a passion for turning ideas into code. I'm currently pursuing Computer Science at Bialystok University of Technology, where I dive into challenging projects and explore innovative solutions.

I love experimenting with new technologies, building projects from scratch, and continuously learning in the ever-evolving world of software development. When I'm not coding, you might find me tinkering with electronics, exploring the latest tech trends, or brainstorming my next big idea over a good cup of ~~coffee~~ tea ðŸ˜‰

Feel free to browse my repositories, check out my projects, and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about technology. Let's create something amazing together!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
